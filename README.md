# Hospital-care-manager-according-to-patient-risk-stratification
 This project aims to develop a hospital care management system that prioritizes patients based on risk stratification. The aim is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of patient care, ensuring that those with the most urgent needs are seen promptly.

 -Main Features:

Risk Stratification: The system will categorize patients based on the severity of their symptoms and medical conditions, using a validated triage algorithm to determine risk level and priority for care;

Queue Management: Based on risk stratification, the system will manage the service queue, ensuring that high-risk patients are seen first.
Patient Registration: The system will enable efficient registration of patients by collecting relevant information such as medical history, current symptoms and contact details;

Reporting and Analytics: The system will provide detailed reporting and real-time analytics to help medical staff monitor the effectiveness of care and identify areas for improvement.

-Expected Benefits:

This system is expected to improve the quality of patient care, reduce waiting times, increase patient satisfaction and optimize the use of hospital resources. Additionally, it can contribute to better health outcomes by ensuring patients receive the care they need when they need it most.
